This is my first ever project in Java, the objective is to build a team of up 6 Pokemons using arrays, exception handling, and user input validation to implement the program. This programs handles invalid input from user by redirecting them instead of crashing. The user is asked various questions, such as if they want to continue building the team, what species they want to build, the number, and their hp. In the end, either the user wants to stop building before 6 or when it reaches 6. The program will print out all of the Pokemon created by the user.
