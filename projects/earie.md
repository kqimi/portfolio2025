"Earie" is an audio streaming app design I created for my UI class. At the time, storytimes, especially about crimes and mysteries, were incredibly popular. I decided to create a design where enthusiasts could easily access and listen to new crime stories every day. Just like podcasts, why not have an app that reads aloud unsolved mysteries and solved crimes, allowing users to listen whenever they want and when they want, without having to go on Youtube.

As part of this project, I created a flowchart to visualize how users would navigate through the app and determine the most user-friendly experience. After that, wireframes were created to help envision what information and buttons to implement into my design. With the wireframes I was able to start prototyping the app. I had to prototype mulitiple times and use Adobe Illustrator as well as XD to create my final project.
